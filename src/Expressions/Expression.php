* An ExpressionParser Expression is something that can be evaluated one row at a time

* They should only have to be built once during query planning,
* with references to column indexes in the query result set, so that
* no additional parsing of column names or aliases needs to be done to
* evaluate them on each row.
*
* This is an inherently recursive object structure. Besides the "constant" and "column"
* expression types, all others will have child elements which are
* themselves of type Expression. In the end they should all have columns or constants as
* inner-most Expression types. For example, a BinaryOperatorExpression
* for the operation "5+5" will have a ConstantExpression as its "left" and "right",
* each of which return 5 when evaluated.
